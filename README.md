## About our team :fire: :fire:

We undertook this project with little to no prior experience with Swift and iOS Development. Three of us had to learn Swift on the spot! Within less than a month, we were able to successfully use SwiftUI, UIKit, and AudioKit to create this wonderful app. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed writing it.
